            St. Joseph's history began almost 100 years before the American Revolution when the mouth of 
            the St. Joseph River was discovered and documented in 1669. Ten years later, the explorer LaSalle 
            and his 14 men cleared a piece of land and started the construction of Fort Miami on the 
            bluff around the St. Joseph River. LaSalle's stay was not long however, and the 
            area was mostly populated by Native Americans, trappers and soldiers until 1785 when 
            William Burnett established a trading post and became the first permanent settler.

            Today, St. Joseph is nestled on the southern tip of what has been termed "The Riviera 
            of the Midwest." This deepwater port town is a growing resort community - part of 
            a "small town" chain stretching from the state line in a spectacular arc along 
            Lake Michigan. Grain, wool, maple sugar, furs, and lumber, tools, hardware and 
            furniture are shipped in and out of the river's mouth. The St. Joseph Lighthouse 
            stands in the midst of activity as boaters, fishermen and water-skiers take advantage 
            of Lake Michigan.
